              <div class='purple'>
                <h3>Public Transportation</h3>
                <p>Metro buses 9, 10, 11, 43, 49, 60, and 84 all have stops within a block of the venue. The venue is also a 20 minute, up hill walk from Westlake, the LightRail's last stop.</p>
                <p>

                <h3>Parking</h3>
                <p>
                  <strong>Friday 7/22:</strong>
                  Most nearby street parking has a two hour maximum, so your best bet is to use one of the many nearby parking lots and
                  garages. The most convenient garage to use is about a block east of the BPH, and it has a $10 early bird rate.
                  The internet is holding the address of this garage secret, so we'll just give you
                  <a class='pink' href='https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rock+Box' target='_blank'>this map,</a>
                  which points to a particular karaoke establishment of which we are quite fond. The garage is one door to the North of that.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Saturday 7/23:</strong>
                  You will find no better deal or convenience than the
                  <a class='pink' href='https://www.google.com/maps/place/1609+Harvard+Ave,+Seattle,+WA+98122/' target='_blank'>Harvard Garage</a>
                  across the street directly behind the BPH. There’s plenty of space, and it costs $5 for all day/night.
                </p>
                <h3>Biking</h3>
                <p>
                  There are a number of public bike racks located nearby, including along Broadway in front of the venue and on the 3rd level of the

                <p>We've made a note of the places that have the widest range of vegan and/or gluten free options, but most other restaurants on this do have some options as well.</p>

It's a charming dive(ish) bar with great food - it's about 3/4 mile from the BPH, which puts it in a slightly less trafficked part of Capitol Hill, and thus can be mellower than some of the bars right nearby.

                <strong>NOTE:</strong>
                The area between Broadway and 12th on Pike and Pine can be a little rowdy after the night gets going. Consider travelling in groups or heading a different direction if that's not a safe or enjoyable vibe for you. (The above options are largely outside of that area, but we thought we'd give you a heads up.)
