<h3 id='purpose'>Purpose</h3>
<p>
A primary goal of Open Source & Feelings is to be safe, inclusive, and
welcoming to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and
diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a
friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender,
gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical
appearance, body size, socioeconomic status, race, age, or religion (or lack thereof).
</p>
<p>
This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate
in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.
</p>
<p>
We invite all those who participate in Open Source & Feelings to help us
create safe and positive experiences for everyone.
</p>
<h3 id='open-citizenship'>Open Citizenship</h3>
<p>
A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open citizenship
by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships
between our actions and their effects on our community.
</p>
<p>
Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action
is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power
that exist in society.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our
community is safe, welcoming, inclusive friendly, and encourages all
participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.
</strong>
Tell an organizer or send an email to
<a href='mailto:conduct@osfeels.com'>conduct@osfeels.com.</a>

<p>
All attendees, organizers, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers at
Open Source & Feelings are required to abide by the code of conduct.

cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everyone.
</p>
<p>
Open Source & Feelings is dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming,
harassment-free conference experience for everyone regardless of gender,
